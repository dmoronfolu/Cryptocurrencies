# Cryptocurrencies

In this analysis, we used unsupervised learning to process data, to cluster, to reduce the dimensions, and to reduce the principal components using PCA. We are to use the preprocessed data to determine what cryptocurrencies are on trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

In the first deliverable, we Preprocessed the data for Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm. In the second deliverable, we reduced the data dimensions Using PCA. In the third deliverable, we clustered the Cryptocurrencies Using K-means. And in the final deliverable, we visualized the cryptocurrency results by creating scatter plots with Plotly Express and hvplot.
